For instance, if you took the exact same transactions and stored them in a different order within a block, the resulting hash would be different.

First, we have an initial commit (the root of our tree) at the top, after which we have 3 commits (added contributors, improvements, and refactor), whose parents are the same.  As you see, we also have 3 branches, master, feature1, and feature2. We also have HEAD which we will talk about in a bit.</p>"},{"location":"knowledge-corner/git/git/#what-is-head-and-head","title":"What is HEAD and HEAD~?","text":"<p>We will move HEAD from time to time in our visual graph.  HEAD is nothing more than a pointer in your git workflow, it just marks where you are.  Now in order to mark other locations, we might need a reference point. That is for instance, if I need to explain to someone where the commit refactor is, I can just say go 2 commits above HEAD and there you will find it.  Thus HEAD~1 is like saying \"the commit above HEAD\" and similarly HEAD~2 is equal to saying \"the commit 2 steps above HEAD\".  By the way HEAD~ is the same as HEAD~1.</p> <p>In order to prove our point let us execute git checkout feature2:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"knowledge-corner/git/git/#what-is-soft-and-hard","title":"What is <code>--soft</code> and <code>--hard</code>","text":"<ul> <li><code>git reset --soft HEAD~</code> - move back one commit and keep your changes</li> <li><code>git reset --hard HEAD~</code> - move back one commit and discard all changes</li> </ul>"},{"location":"knowledge-corner/git/git/#modify-a-commit","title":"Modify a commit","text":"<p>You might sometimes commit a work-in-progress and immediately realize you forgot to add something to the commit.</p> <ul> <li><code>git add</code> - add the missing/modified file(s) you forgot to add</li> <li><code>git commit --amend --no-edit</code> - alter the previous commit (remove <code>--no-edit</code> if you want to modify the commit message)</li> </ul> <p>This will replace your commit with a fresh new one.
