# ðŸ›  Rigorous & Deliberate Workflow ðŸ› 

## Overview

This document introduces the "Rigorous & Deliberate" workflow, designed for
tasks requiring meticulous planning, thorough reviews, and a deliberate pace to
ensure the highest quality outcomes.

## Terminology

### Review Cycle

- An iterative process where tasks undergo multiple checks before approval.
  
### Auditor

- An individual responsible for overseeing and verifying task details.
  
### Slow-Track

- A designated path for tasks that need extended research, design, or
  development time.

### Quality Gate

- A checkpoint ensuring tasks meet the set standards.

## Primitives

- Multiple Review Cycles.
- A dedicated Auditor for each task.
- Designated Slow-Track tasks.
- Quality Gates at each workflow phase.

## Ground Rules

- All tasks undergo at least two Review Cycles.
- Auditors have the final say on task completion and quality.
- Slow-Track tasks aren't subjected to time constraints but need deeper reviews.
- Tasks only proceed after passing the Quality Gate.

## Stages

### Research & Design

- Tasks begin with a thorough research phase, ensuring a solid foundation.
- Once research is complete, design proposals are formulated and reviewed by the
  Auditor.

### Development

- Development starts after design approval.
- Slow-Track designation can be assigned here if needed.
- Regular check-ins with the Auditor ensure the task aligns with the project's
  objectives.

### Review & Refinement

- Tasks undergo multiple Review Cycles, with feedback addressed in each
  iteration.
- Auditors verify the task's integrity, functionality, and alignment with
  initial goals.

### Deployment & Feedback

- Once the Auditor gives approval, tasks move to deployment.
- A feedback mechanism ensures that any issues post-deployment are addressed in
  future cycles.

## Status Updates

- Updates are given weekly to account for the workflow's extended duration.
- Three key points to address:
  1. Progress since the last update.
  2. Immediate next steps.
  3. Any obstacles or challenges encountered.

## Definition of Completion

A task is deemed complete when:

- It has successfully passed through all stages.
- Received Auditor approval post multiple reviews.
- No outstanding feedback exists that could compromise its quality.
