# Rigorous & Deliberate Workflow

## Overview

This guide provides insight into our "Rigorous & Deliberate" workflow, designed for projects and goals that require a meticulous approach and careful scrutiny before merging changes.

## Terminology

- **Goal**: A clear and distinct unit of work. Each goal should have enough detail to be self-contained, enabling anyone to understand its scope.
- **Merge Request (MR)**: A request to merge a branch into the main codebase. It includes the changes to be reviewed and, if accepted, merged.
- **Reviewer**: A designated team member responsible for thoroughly inspecting and vetting the changes in the MR.
- **Merge**: The act of integrating approved changes into the main codebase.

## Principles

- **Depth Over Speed**: Emphasize comprehensiveness. Inspect each MR deeply to ensure alignment with our standards.
- **Collective Ownership**: The quality of the codebase is everyone's responsibility. Reviewers act as gatekeepers, but all team members must prioritize excellence in their contributions.
- **Iterative Feedback**: Provide constructive and iterative feedback during the review process, allowing the original author to refine and improve their work based on multiple perspectives.

## Stages & Steps

1. **Goal Definition**: 
   * Identify and articulate a clear goal or objective for the project.
2. **Research & Foundation**:
   * Undertake comprehensive research.
   * Use findings to establish a robust foundation for subsequent stages.
   * Create detailed design proposals based on research and the set goal.
   * Submit the design for review to the Auditor to ensure alignment with the overarching goal.
3. **Initiation of Development**:
   * Post design approval, begin the development phase.
   * Open an early branch and initiate a draft PR, ensuring it's appropriately labeled.
4. **Continuous Updates & Communication**: 
   * Keep all stakeholders informed by consistently updating relevant documents or files (e.g., PR, issue, doc, .md).
   * Provide monthly updates highlighting progress since the last communication, forthcoming steps, and any challenges encountered.
   * Schedule regular check-ins with the Auditor.
   * This ensures the work remains aligned with the project's objectives and the originally set goal.
   * Engage in regular reviews or pair programming sessions.
   * Aim for monthly collaborations to share knowledge and enhance code quality.
5. **Documentation**:
   * Prioritize comprehensive documentation, especially for intricate tasks.
   * Ensure it's clear, detailed, and easily understandable.
6. **Review & Feedback**:
   * Appoint a minimum of two reviewers for detailed feedback.
   * Their insights ensure quality, functionality, and alignment with the goal.
   * Before concluding, the Auditor assesses the project for integrity, functionality, and congruence with the initially set goals.
## Recommendations

* **Open Dialogue**: Encourage open communication among team members. Regular discussions can lead to proactive problem-solving and innovation.
* **Adaptable Milestones**: While sticking to the goal is crucial, allow for minor adjustments to milestones based on feedback and unforeseen challenges.
- **Stay Updated**: Always work with the latest version of the main codebase to minimize merge conflicts.
- **Open Communication**: If you're unsure at any stage, communicate. Whether you're the goal owner or a reviewer, open dialogue ensures clarity and quality.

## Definition of Completion

A goal is considered complete when:

- It has successfully passed through all stages.
- It has received Auditor approval after multiple reviews.
- There are no outstanding feedback points that could compromise its quality.
