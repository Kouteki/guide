# Engineering Workflows

Our guiding philosophies are **Flexibility** and **Polar Adaptability**.
These principles underline our belief in processes that are encouraged rather than enforced,
ensuring that while we benefit from structure,
it doesn't come at the cost of innovation or situational needs.

## Flexibility & Polar Adaptability in Practice:

- **Fast Iterations vs. Protected Slow Processes**: Some tasks thrive on quick cycles, continuous adaptation, and inter-team dependencies.
  On the other end of the spectrum, certain endeavors, especially discussions and research, need to move at a deliberate, protected pace.
  This slower approach ensures that they're not rushed, preventing premature conclusions.
  Both extremes have their place, and we champion the value of each.
- **Varied Review Depths**: While crucial tasks necessitate thorough reviews and extensive unit testing, others are straightforward.
  For the simpler tasks, we leave the choice to the individualâ€”either opt for a review or take full ownership of the potential consequences.

## Workflows:

We offer several suggested workflows.
Teams can either adopt one of these or pave their own path, as long as it aligns with our overarching philosophies.

### 1. **Infinito Tablero** (Infinite Kanban)
- For small and medium teams tackling complex projects.

### 2. **Rigorous & Deliberate**
- Prioritizes depth and broad collaboration, even with part-timers or external contributors.
[Details](./rigorous-deliberate.md)

### 3. **Criteria-Based**
- Clear objectives for engagements with less visibility into our broader goals.

### 4. **Your Proposal Here**
We encourage innovative approaches. If you see a need, propose a new workflow.

## Key Points:

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Projects within our system are built hierarchically. This means top-tier projects act as the umbrella, orchestrating and overseeing sub-projects to ensure alignment and efficiency.
- **Unique Yet Unified**: While each team or project can define its own unique set of rules, it's expected that many will find alignment with established conventions. This balance fosters both innovation and consistency.
- **Smart Communication**: Every team member plays a crucial role in maintaining clarity. Gone are the days of endlessly scouring dashboards. Instead, we focus on smart, effective, and timely communication to keep everyone in the loop.
- **Flexibility Above All**: At the heart of our operations is flexibility. While processes serve as valuable roadmaps, they shouldn't feel restrictive. Every team member is empowered to adapt processes when it's in the best interest of the team and the mission at large.
