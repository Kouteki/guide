# Solo Voyager Workflow

This workflow is tailored for those who thrive in autonomy: individual contributors or domain experts. As a Solo Voyager, the responsibility is immense. While you navigate your path, it's vital to align perfectly with the broader project goals, preventing any clashes and ensuring your contribution seamlessly integrates.

## Principles

- **Proactive Engagement**: Solo Voyagers, more than anyone, must be adept at showcasing their work, staying informed, and anticipating the team's needs.
- **High Accountability & Autonomy**: The onus is on the contributor to not only execute but to ensure their work aligns flawlessly with the overarching project goals.
- **Preventive Action**: Be vigilant about potential conflicts and actively work to prevent them, even if it means extra diligence on your part.
- **Self-sufficiency with Transparency**: While you chart your course, regular and transparent communication is non-negotiable.

## Stages

1. **Task Selection & Planning**:
   * Choose or receive an assignment, chart a plan, and determine timelines. Validate that it aligns with the broader goals.

2. **Self-driven Execution**:
   * Delve into the task, making informed decisions while ensuring alignment with the main project's progress and shifts.

3. **Consistent Reporting**:
   * Periodically update on progress, challenges, and findings, ensuring your work remains visible and understood.

4. **Synchronization & Alignment**:
   * Join scheduled sync-ups to reaffirm alignment, gather feedback, and share updates.

5. **Completion & Rigorous Documentation**:
   * Conclude the task, meticulously document outcomes, and confirm that the contribution fits the project's evolving landscape.

## Recommendations

* **Stay Aligned**: Regularly check the broader project updates to ensure your work remains relevant and fits seamlessly.
* **Embrace Feedback**: Even in solitude, actively seek feedback, and be open to course corrections.
* **Own the Outcome**: Be prepared for intense scrutiny. If a contribution doesn't align, regardless of its quality, it might not get merged. Accept this as part and parcel of the Solo Voyager's journey.
