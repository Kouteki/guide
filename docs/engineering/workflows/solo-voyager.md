# Solo Voyager Workflow

Designed for the independent at heart: individual contributors or domain
experts. Embarking on the Solo Voyager journey demands deep responsibility.
While charting their path, voyagers must align impeccably with broader project
goals, ensuring their contributions fit even in the absence of daily guidance.

## Principles

- **Proactive Engagement**: Solo Voyagers must stay informed, anticipate needs, and adeptly showcase their work.
- **High Accountability & Autonomy**: It's upon the voyager to execute and guarantee alignment with the overarching goals.
- **Preventive Action**: Constant vigilance about potential conflicts and active prevention is a must.
- **Transparent Self-Reliance**: Even in autonomy, regular and transparent communication remains crucial.

## Stages

1. **Task Selection & Planning**:
   * Choose or receive an assignment, and confirm its alignment with broader goals. 
   * Regularly check broader project updates to ensure your chosen direction remains relevant.

2. **Self-driven Execution**:
   * Dive into the task, making decisions that align with the main project's progress.
   * Even in solitude, actively seek feedback, and be open to course corrections.

3. **Consistent Reporting**:
   * Provide periodic updates on progress, challenges, and findings. This keeps your work visible and understood.
   * Join scheduled sync-ups to reaffirm alignment and share updates, ensuring you're on track.

4. **Completion & Rigorous Documentation**:
   * Finish the task, documenting outcomes meticulously.
   * Be prepared for scrutiny. If a contribution doesn't align, irrespective of
     quality, it may not merge. Understand this as an inherent aspect of the
     Solo Voyager's route.

## Note

The Solo Voyager's journey demands high responsibility, with the outcome resting
squarely on the individual. It's a path of freedom, yet with the need for
impeccable alignment and continuous awareness.
